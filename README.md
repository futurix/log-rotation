# Log Rotation Module for Apache

Once upon a time I ran my own web server using Apache on Windows Server 2003 (because I'm weird). I couldn't find any decent log rotation module for Apache that would work on Windows, so here is my own port.

Don't ask why - I have no idea.

Tools: Visual C++ 2005, Apache header files
